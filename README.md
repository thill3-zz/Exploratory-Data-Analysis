# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This Repository contains the graphs and code for the final project in the Exploratory Data Analysis course from Coursera

The six .png files are the graphs requested, and the six .R files are the code that generates each.
In addition I've included the data files so that you can follow along and adjust whatever you like.

The graphs are as follows
1) Using the base plotting system to show the total emissions from PM2.5 (fine grain particulate matter, i.e. dust) over the entire USA in each of 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
2) Using the base plotting system to show changes in total PM2.5 emissions for Baltimore City Maryland.
3) Using the ggplot2 system to show the progression of PM2.5  by each type of source over each of the four years.# 3) Of the four types of sources indicated by the type 
4) Showing how coal emissions have changed over the interval in the entire USA
5) Showing how emissions from motor vehicles have changed over the interval in Baltimore City (MD)
6) Showing changes in emissions from motor vehicles over the four yearly measurememnts in Los Angeles County (CA) and Baltimore City (MD)

Note that I cannot upload the actual data file because it is too large for Github. The classification codes provide some insight into what is meant by the numeric codes in the data file. Most helpfully this allows for determining whether the carbon source was coal, vehicle, or whatever other kind.
